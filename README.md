Meltdown Mitigation:
Short description: Develop a simple control system for a nuclear reactor. For a reactor to produce the power it must be in a state of criticality.

Details: https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/isbn-verifier

Rotational Cipher:
Short description: Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key between 0 and 26. Using a key of 0 or 26 will always yield the same output due to modular arithmetic. The letter is shifted for as many values as the value of the key.

Resistor Color Trio:
Short description: In Resistor Color Duo you decoded the first two colors. For instance: orange-orange got the main value 33. The third color stands for how many zeros need to be added to the main value. The main value plus the zeros gives us a value in ohms. For the exercise it doesn't matter what ohms really are. Translate the colors into a label.
Details: https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/resistor-color-trio

Resistor Color Expert:
Short description: In resistor-color trio you decoded the first three colors. For instance: orange-orange-brown translated to the main value 330. In this exercise you will need to add tolerance to the mix. Tolerance is the maximum amount that a value can be above or below the main value. For example, if the last band is green, the maximum tolerance will be ±0.5%.
